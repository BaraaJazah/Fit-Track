        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <p class="update-date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 7, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Daily Calories</strong> (the "App"). These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your
            use of
            the App and any related services provided by or on behalf of Daily Calories. By downloading, installing, or
            using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App</strong>: Daily Calories mobile application and any related services or features.</li>
            <li><strong>User</strong>: any person who downloads, registers for, or uses the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Content</strong>: all information, data, text, images, and other materials displayed or provided
                through the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Nutrition Data</strong>: nutritional information and food composition data sourced from USDA
                FoodData Central and other reputable sources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Purpose and Scope</h2>
        <p>The App provides tools for tracking food intake, calories, macronutrients, simple exercises, and personal
            goals such as weight loss or weight gain. The App uses Nutrition Data to calculate and display nutritional
            values for foods and meals.</p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>By using the App you represent that you are at least the legal age required in your jurisdiction to form a
            binding contract with us. If you are using the App on behalf of another person (for example a minor), you
            agree that you have the authority to do so and to bind that person to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>4. Account Registration &amp; User Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You may be required to create an account to access certain features. You are responsible for maintaining
                the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
            </li>
            <li>You agree to provide accurate and complete information when registering and to update such information
                as
                necessary.</li>
            <li>The App stores non-sensitive personal data (e.g., age, weight, height, goals, food logs). You are
                responsible for the accuracy of the information you enter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Nutrition Data &amp; Accuracy</h2>
        <p>The App primarily relies on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) FoodData Central database and other
            reputable sources for nutritional values. While we strive to provide accurate data, values may vary by
            product brand, preparation method, serving size, or lab analysis. Nutritional information in the App is an
            estimate and should be used for general guidance only.</p>

        <h2>6. Medical &amp; Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The App is for general informational and educational purposes only. It is not a
            substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The App does not provide medical,
            nutritional, or other professional health services or advice. Always seek the advice of a qualified health
            professional before starting any diet, exercise, or weight-related program, especially if you have existing
            medical conditions, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking medications.</p>

        <h2>7. Use Restrictions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You must not use the App for any unlawful or prohibited purpose.</li>
            <li>You shall not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App or its data sources, or
                otherwise interfere with the App's operation.</li>
            <li>Misuse of the App, including manipulating data to avoid medical oversight, is strictly prohibited.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Subscriptions, Payments & Refunds </h2>
        <p>Some features of the App may require payment or subscription. All fees and billing terms will be clearly
            disclosed at the time of purchase. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, payments are non-refundable. You are
            responsible for any taxes associated with purchases.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may integrate with third-party services (e.g., analytics providers, payment processors, or remote
            databases). Your use of those services is subject to the third parties' terms and policies. We are not
            responsible for the content or practices of third parties.</p>
